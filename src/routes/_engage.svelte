	<h1>The day we got engaged</h1>

	<p>
		My friends and I had been planning for a friend’s birthday. We diligently planned for the day.
		The birthday anniversary was June 13, 2020.

		<br />
		<br />

		<strong>THEIR GAME PLAN:</strong> Few days to the event, the surprise crew called to inform me
		about the dress code. I had no idea that they were preparing me for my proposal which was
		happening the same day. My boyfriend had made plans with them. I ensured I had everything ready
		for the day.

		<br />
		<br />

		Fast forward to the day, we arrived at my friend’s place to surprise her (with a birthday
		party). She was amazed and very happy.

		<br />
		<br />

		<strong>THE STAGE & MOMENT:</strong> Next, we decided to step out and take some pictures.
		While we were returning, I didn’t realize I was the one taking the lead in front. I opened the
		door, and to my surprise, there was my man inside the room brightened up with lighted candles
		and petals.

		<br />
		<br />

		<em
			>I felt lost and shocked! I kept asking my friends what was going on and how Kolawole (my guy)
			got to know this place.</em
		>

		<br />
		<br />

		While I was trying to understand (what was really going on), my boyfriend got on one knee and
		asked me to marry him.

		<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Of course, I said YES!</strong>
		<br />
		<br />

		He is proof that God makes all things beautiful in his own time. I introduced him to my family
		as the man I would be spending the rest of my life with.

		<br />
		<br />
		<br />

		<em
			>To sum it up, the proposal was a situation where a ‘surpriser’ got surprised (if there is any
			word like that, lol).</em
