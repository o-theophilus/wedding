	<h1>Our Story</h1>
	<h2>The 14th of October 2007</h2>
	<p>
		We met at church 13 years ago. At the time Dayo had just moved from Nigeria, he became a member
		of the church which I attended with my family. Dayo’s twin sister (Yinka) and I became friends
		shortly after their arrival but unknown to them this friendship would blossom into more.
		<br />
		<br />
		Once in a while , I and Dayo would see at church but didn’t engage in much interaction. Until we
		became very good friends and eventually he asked me to be his girlfriend. At the time we were both
		very young and under strict rules and could only see at choir practice on Saturday’s. We would schedule
		times to meet up and walk to practice with Yinka and his close friend.
		<br />
		<br />
		A few years later my family moved further away which created distance causing us to break up. We
		had an on and off whirlwind romance for many years. Eventually, I moved to Nigeria after my first
		degree and we separated. Unknown to us that would meet again in the future and our happily ever after
		would be re-written.
		<br />
		<br />
		Almost three years later he messaged “Merry Christmas” and we began a secret friendship that eventually
		led them into the relationship that brought us officially back together and here we are many moon’s
		later I and Dayo are tying the knot.
