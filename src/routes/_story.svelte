		<h1>Our Story</h1>
		<h2>The 29th of October 2019</h2>
		<p>
			It was 29th October 2019, and I was working on a project at work. My boss brought in a
			creative consultant for the project and we were added to a WhatsApp group chat. He sent me a
			direct message after seeing my picture on the group chat. “You are cute, Hope”, the very first
			words he said to me. I smiled and replied, “thank you”. Days after, he checked on me and we
			got talking. As we conversed and got to know each other, I found out that we share a couple of
			common interests one of these interests being his love for God and wanting to live for Christ.
			It was at this point, that he got my full attention. Three dates after, and he took me to his
			parents.
