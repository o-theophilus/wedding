		<h1>The Day They Got Engaged</h1>
		He proposed on the 23rd of May 2020. It was an intimate proposal at his house immediately after the
		lockdown ease. Cake, hanging balloons, petals and floating candles. He gave a beautiful speech, got
		on one knee and asked me to marry him! I said ‘YES OF COURSE’ lol and friends that were hidden in
		the room came out filming the moment. It was a lovely proposal and I am truly excited about this
		beautiful journey because I know that this is God’s will. .
