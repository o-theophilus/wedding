		<h1>The Day They Got Engaged</h1>
		<p>
			He proposed on the 23rd of May 2020. It was an intimate proposal at his house immediately
			after the lockdown ease. Cake, hanging balloons, petals and floating candles. He gave a
			beautiful speech, got on one knee and asked me to marry him! I said ‘YES OF COURSE’ lol and
			friends that were hidden in the room came out filming the moment. It was a lovely proposal and
			I am truly excited about this beautiful journey because I know that this is God’s will. .
