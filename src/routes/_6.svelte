	<h1>The day we got engaged</h1>
	<p>
		He proposed on the 23rd of May 2020. It was an intimate proposal at his house immediately after
		the lockdown ease. Cake, hanging balloons, petals and floating candles. He gave a beautiful
		speech, got on one knee and asked me to marry him! I said ‘YES OF COURSE’ lol and friends that
		were hidden in the room came out filming the moment. It was a lovely proposal and I am truly
		excited about this beautiful journey because I know that this is God’s will. .
